# FlexiS

The source code used to produce the results presented in [1] is under "src".

You can find the applications used to generate greedy flows in all experiments presented in [1] under the "apps" folder.

The LBE CCs including FlexiS, LEDBAT and TCP-LP have unexpected behavior when Iperf is used to generate greedy flows in the CORE emulator [2].
